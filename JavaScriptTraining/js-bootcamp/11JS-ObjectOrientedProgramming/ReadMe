Arrow function don't bind this.

Object Oriented Programming
Orirented Programming is programming based on some concepts.
Objects are used to represent real world things. Person, Car

Oops promote code reuseablilty. 
Object is JS

Const person = {
    firstName : 'Vineesh',
    lastName : 'Chauhan',
    age : 10,
    getBio(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} age is ${this.age}`
    }
}

//using oops, we can create function which serves us as a template.
const person1 = new Person('Vineesh', 'Chauhan', 32)
const person2 = new Person('Akanksha', 'Chaudhary', 32)

person1.getBio()
person2.getBio()

Person Prototype = Prototype will define how the objects will behave or look.
